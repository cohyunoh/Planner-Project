  Response to Egoless Programming
  1. Try to view code less as an extension of oneself, rather as simply code. Thus, we should try to review each other's code and ask questions about certain design choices within the code.
  2. Learn to ask for help when needed, and don't take the discovery of bugs in one's program personally.
